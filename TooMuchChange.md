    * Create classifications and policies for Zeus missions
        * Goal: 
            * To improve player and zeus experiences by clearly setting expectations for all involved.
            * No surprises, no confusion = less disappointment.
        * Ideas:
            * Group zeus missions into some kind of groupings
            * Make clearly communicated policies on what restrictions are allowed for each
                * Fun Op
                    * Rules apply, military sense does not.
                    * basic uniform, caliber, and support weapon restrictions
                * Serious Op
                    * Play your role is no longer a light suggestion.  
                    * Expect to be criticized when you do not meet leadership expectations.
                        * This does not mean punishement.  This means critique with intent to improve.
                    * Faction, time period, theater-specific restrictions.  Uniform can extend to vests and backpacks.
                * NAK Op
                    * Primarily a Serious Op with sanctioned restrictions and a focus on showing our best to the greater public.
                    * Faction, time period, theater-specific restrictions. Uniform can extend to vests and backpacks. 
                    * Medical? (Should this be NAK Tac only?)
                    * Role based Equipment? (Should this be NAK Tac only?)
                * Unit Op (NAK Tac)
                    * Anything goes?  What is this?
                * Should there be base restrictions (unrestricted?) that always apply?
                    * Face, facewear, gloves, scarves, kneepads always unrestricted to allow for individuallity
                    * Optics should allow for some variety due to how different PC hardware interacts with different optics
                    * NVG's same as above.
                    * I'm sure there's others...
                * The Temperance Rule:
                    * Zeus can offer any restrictions (except the unrestricted category?) so long as players unanimously agree to the restrictions.  
                    * Players who join later who do not wish to agree to the restriction follow normal policy regarding restrictions.
                    * This is known as voluntary self-restraint or Temperance.
        * Test
            * How do we test this out?  One type at a time?  
            * How to we measure the response or impact?
                * Survey results?
                    * Are surveys reliable?  
                    * mostly admins and mods?  Does this skew results or make them better?
                    * Are most survey results biased already?
                    * When players tire of doing surveys, how do we incent them to continue to give valuable feedback?
                        * achievement / ts badge?
                        * surveyor of the month?
                        * Just a cool chart with the top 5 score of survey submitters
        * Make the change
        * Measure the results
        * THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF TOO MANY GOALS IN ONE CHANGE!!!
