# NAK CMD site

## Meeting notes

### NAK Cmd monthly meeting
  * 2nd Saturday of each month @ 15:00 server time (Eastern/US)

### What is NAK Cmd?
  * Revise and publish Admin Code of Conduct ``TODO: CoS``
    * Hold ourselves to a higher standard.
    * No hyprocrisy!  Admins and moderators are not immune to the rules.
  * Revise and publish Expectations of Admins ``TODO: CoS``
    * Clear communication from admins to their department leadership
    * Initiative when dealing with policies and tasks associated with their department
  * Revise and publish Expectations of Moderators ``TODO: Admin Mgmt``
    * Something to offer the community without getting into administrative tasks
    * Policing the servers and community
    * Senior Moderators are to take punitive, escallating action towards rule violators
    * Junior Moderators are to always record questionable actions observed and initiate the kick/ban process according to their rank

### Update of Information
  * Things are getting way out of date for both NAK Cmd and for players.
  * We need to make sure it's clear who should be maintaining each piece of information
  * And who is responsible for publishing it (if it's not the same person)
  * And who and how do we track the changes into a changelog.
  * New software to do this should likely wait until after we have established an R&D department
    * We can leverage Guilded to centralize document storage and distribution 
    * When a new doc is uploaded that needs to be published create a task on that department's task board to publish that information wherever it's needed
      * could be multiple places, make multiple tasks
  * Create list of information by department ``TODO: Division Heads``

### New Changes, Expectations and goals for each Division, Key Performance Indicators, Decisions on Changes
  * Define a simple goal
  * Define goals and share them with others for feedback
    * CoS should assign goals to divisions
    * Division heads should also create goals for their division
    * All other changes should be reviewed with division heads before becoming a goal
  * Propose potential changes
  * Clearly define when these changes are expected 
  * Define what success looks like and how to measure it
  * Make a decision to go forward
  * Make the change
  * Measure the impact
  * Celebrate your success (publish results) or reverse the changes if they aren't positive.
  * Division head or their delegate makes the call of any change go/no-go decision
    * other Division admins can not overrule a decision made by a Division head
