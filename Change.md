    * How to implement change
        * Define what the goal is
            * Keep it focused and simple
            * Break multiple goals into multiple changes and do them one at a time for best results
        * Collect ideas on how to achieve goal(s)
            * TS brainstorming, forums, discord or late night walks in the woods alone.  
        * Test these ideas 
            * in thought, words or practice
        * Make the change
            * This could mean propose, revise, seek final approval, implement
            * Or just say "we're doing this" and do it
            * Departments have different needs
            * Should always be a Go/No-Go call made by the department head or their delegate(s)
        * Measure the results
            * How can you measure this?
            * Did it actually accomplish the goal?
            * If not, should we back out the change and try again?
            * What did we learn for next time?
