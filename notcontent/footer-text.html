<center><h3>Become part of the NAK Community.</h3></center>

  <p align="justify">NAK Squad has been running gaming servers since 2016.<br>
  Although much of our focus is on Arma 3, we explore new games as they are released with the intention of expanding the NAK community.<br>
  We view NAK Squad as a family of members who are distributed all around the world.<br>
  Our goal is to provide and promote a gaming environment that is safe for everyone.<br>
  Along with our numerous game servers, we offer a TeamSpeak 3 server that provides a “Live Chatroom” for everyone to use.<br>
  Using TeamSpeak will help improve your gaming experience and increases the sense of community.<br>
  Welcome to NAK Squad and I hope to see you on our servers soon.</p>
