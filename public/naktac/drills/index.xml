      <description>Battle Drill 1: Conducting an Assault  Battle Drill 1 is a simple offensive plan, with our side firing the first shot. The most planned battle drill is a simple assault or flanking assault. Nearly all assault plans are based off the guiding principle that once the assault begins, there is no fire without movement and there is no movement without fire. Violent action alone does not take ground in a meaningful way and neither does moving through it without dominating that territory.</description>
