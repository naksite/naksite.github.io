                Some of the things you can expect.
Voice Communication  Your microphone must be well adjusted and you must be able to communicate clearly. If you are in an environment with a lot of background noise, you may be required to use push-to-talk. Your microphone should only be transmitting your voice and only when intended. IRL conversations and other loud and/or unexpected noises are distracting to both the basic immersion of the mission and to communication itself.

            <p>
                While there may be specific training for certain procedures, much of what you need to know can be found as a standard operating procedure here. We prefer that most knowledge starts with SOPs and is perfected and enhanced with training and experience rather than solely through training and experience.
We cover these the four basic roles in this SOP guide because nine times out of ten, a player is going to find himself in one of these roles.

            <p>
                Battle Drill 1: Conducting an Assault  Battle Drill 1 is a simple offensive plan, with our side firing the first shot. The most planned battle drill is a simple assault or flanking assault. Nearly all assault plans are based off the guiding principle that once the assault begins, there is no fire without movement and there is no movement without fire. Violent action alone does not take ground in a meaningful way and neither does moving through it without dominating that territory.

            <p>
                The idea behind a &ldquo;battle drill&rdquo; is that it is a standardized way to react to a common battlefield event. Battle drills ensure that everyone is on the same page of music, so to speak, and allows for a rapid reaction to an event with the minimum of orders needing to be issued.
Understand that simple drills and clear commands will have a disproportionate effect on outcomes. Effective battle drills will mean you have an instant PLAN which can be immediately modified by the tactical leader as necessary for the situation.

            <p>
                Battle Drill 2: Reaction to Contact / Reaction to Enemy Fire  Battle Drill 2 is nearly identical, however the enemy initiated the firefight.  The most fundamental battle drill is reacting to enemy fire. It forms the basis for many of the other tactics covered in this guide, and these guidelines should be kept in mind when reading about them and applied as necessary.
General Fundamental Principles  React immediately  Return fire Communicate Seek cover All at the same time!
