* CMD Meetings
** 20230513
*** NAKCmd Monthly meeting
    + 2nd Saturday of each month @ 15:00 server time (Eastern/US)
*** What is NAKCmd?
**** TODO Revise and publish Admin Code of Conduct
     + Hold outselves to a higher standard.
     + No hyprocrisy!  Admins and moderators are not immune to the rules.
**** TODO Revise and publish Expectations of Admins
     + Clear communication from admins to their department leadership
     + Use initiative when dealing with policies and tasks associated with their department
**** TODO Revise and publish Expectations of Moderators
     + Something to offer the community without getting into administrative tasks
     + Policing the servers and community
     + Senior Moderators are to take punitive, escallation action towards rule violators
     + Junion Moderators are to always record questionable actions observed and initiate the kick/ban process according to their rank
*** Update of Information
    + Things are getting way out of date for both NAK Cmd and for players.
    + We need to make sure it's clear who should be maintaining each piece of information
    + And who is responsible for publishing it (if it's not the same person)
    + And who and how do we track the changes into a changelog.
    + New software to do this should likely wait until after we have established an R&D department
      - We can leverage Guilded to centralize document storage and distribution
      - When a new doc is uploaded that needs to be published create a task on that department's task board to publish that information wherever it's needed
        - could be multiple places, make multiple tasks
**** TODO Create list of information available and needed by department ``TODO: Division Heads``
*** New Changes, Expectations and goals for each Division, Key Performance Indicators, Decisions on Changes
    + Define a simple goal
    + Define goals and share them with others for feedback
      - CoS should assign goals to divisions
      - Division heads should also create goals for their division
      - All other changes should be reviewed with division heads before becoming a goal
    + Propose potential changes
    + Clearly define when these changes are expected
    + Define what success looks like and how to measure it
    + Make a decision to go forward
    + Make the change
    + Measure the impact
    + Celebrate your success (publish results) or reverse the changes if they aren't positive.
    + Division head or their delegate makes the call of any change go/no-go decision
      - other Division admins can not overrule a decision made by a Division head
