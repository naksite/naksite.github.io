**** Communications
***** not present today

      - shows when mods have reached milestones for promotions
      - allows for multiple department officers to facilitate promotions instead of just dept head
***** creating a video on how to do bans
      - timestamps direct to examples of each rule violation
***** multiple videos for other FAQs for new admins
      - how to teleport
      - spectate
      - use the admin menu

**** CoS
***** Website needs complete revamp
      - might need paid plugins, themes
***** Need to push for donations
      - more Box for Box depends on it
***** Paypal is how we pay for things
      - need a debit card for places that don't accept paypal
      - will be creating a more transparent way to show our expenses to encourage players to donate
***** Server upgrades to help with performance issues

**** HR
***** Ask players about their skills
      - This doesn't mean you will get tasks assigned to you, it might be just to have someone come to you for advice
***** Continue to encourage all admins to add their skills to doc
      - make doc consumable
***** players can help without being part of NAK CMD
***** Propose Staff position for non-admin non-mod workers.
      - New tag for Content Contributor (just contributor?)
      - Nak bucks for work?
***** We are all volunteers
      - Task lists are going to get super long.  That's what they're for.
      - The trick is to keep track of what needs to be done and where everyone is at with each task so they CAN take a long time
      - Try not to feel overwhelmed by it.  If you do, talk to your department head and if that doesn't work a Chief of Staff.
      - You can always talk to me about how to work through the list and keep things organized or spread tasks out.

**** R&D
***** Add Department tags to Guilded, discord, TS, more?
***** Create Index site for Youtube videos?
      - for admins?
      - maybe for all documents?

**** Next meeting July 8, same time


** 20230513

*** NAKCmd Monthly meeting
    + 2nd Saturday of each month @ 15:00 server time (Eastern/US)

*** What is NAKCmd?
**** TODO Revise and publish Admin Code of Conduct
     + Hold outselves to a higher standard.
     + No hyprocrisy!  Admins and moderators are not immune to the rules.
**** TODO Revise and publish Expectations of Admins
     + Clear communication from admins to their department leadership
     + Use initiative when dealing with policies and tasks associated with their department
**** TODO Revise and publish Expectations of Moderators
     + Something to offer the community without getting into administrative tasks
     + Policing the servers and community
     + Senior Moderators are to take punitive, escallation action towards rule violators
     + Junion Moderators are to always record questionable actions observed and initiate the kick/ban process according to their rank

*** Update of Information
    + Things are getting way out of date for both NAK Cmd and for players.
    + We need to make sure it's clear who should be maintaining each piece of information
    + And who is responsible for publishing it (if it's not the same person)
    + And who and how do we track the changes into a changelog.
    + New software to do this should likely wait until after we have established an R&D department
      - We can leverage Guilded to centralize document storage and distribution
      - When a new doc is uploaded that needs to be published create a task on that department's task board to publish that information wherever it's needed
        - could be multiple places, make multiple tasks
**** TODO Create list of information available and needed by department ``TODO: Division Heads``

*** Changes
    + Covers multiple topics:
      - New Changes
      - Expectations and goals for each Division
      - Key Performance Indicators
      - Decisions on Changes
    + Define a simple goal
    + Define goals and share them with others for feedback
      - CoS should assign goals to divisions
      - Division heads should also create goals for their division
      - All other changes should be reviewed with division heads before becoming a goal
    + Propose potential changes
    + Clearly define when these changes are expected
    + Define what success looks like and how to measure it
    + Make a decision to go forward
    + Make the change
    + Measure the impact
    + Celebrate your success (publish results) or reverse the changes if they aren't positive.
    + Division head or their delegate makes the call of any change go/no-go decision
      - other Division admins can not overrule a decision made by a Division head
