### Tactical Tuesday
- Tuesdays @ 7pm Eastern/US

- Any allowed mods
- Please do not run RHS as it breaks sound for others on this server.
- If you are joining the event you must be in the event channel in teamspeak.
- You must follow the event commanders orders during the event. If that is not something you wish to do, you are free to use the other channels and the server as you see fit within the normal NAK rules.
- CAS will not be allowed to fire without being directed by JTAC.
- If there is no JTAC, CAS will be allowed to fire on targets of opportunity, but will be expected to avoid friendly fire.
