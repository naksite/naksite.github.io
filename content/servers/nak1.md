### Event rules

- If you are joining the event you must be in the event channel in teamspeak.

- CAS will not be allowed to fire without being directed by JTAC.
- If there is no JTAC, CAS will be allowed to fire on targets of opportunity, but will be expected to avoid friendly fire.
- If you are not taking part in the event, you are free to do as you please, but you may be asked to move to another channel if the event commander needs to speak to the event channel.
- Use direct in-game chat for buddy-team communications.
- Use in-game comms for squad communications.
- Use TeamSpeak for Platoon Net, CAS, Transport, Logi and inter-squad communications.
