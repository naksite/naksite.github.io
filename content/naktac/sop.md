While there may be specific training for certain procedures, much of what you need to know can be found as a standard operating procedure here.  We prefer that most knowledge starts with SOPs and is perfected and enhanced with training and experience rather than solely through training and experience.

We cover these the four basic roles in this SOP guide because nine times out of ten, a player is going to find himself in one of these roles. Tankers, pilots and specialists are all rare slots in high demand.

Additional guides will be provided for more specialized roles including combat medic, vehicle crew and leadership slots.

## Structure
Military formations are all built upon the organization of smaller elements into more powerful and capable fighting units. With infantry, the smallest level of organization is the Buddy Team. They are the minimum group size that should have specific orders or goals as individuals do not last long in combat and are considered to be entirely ineffective. 

A buddy team consists of two or more soldiers who work together to keep each other alive. If you find yourself alone on the battlefield, find another lone soldier and form a new Buddy Team. While it could be thought that the level of tactics that two men could utilize and employ might seem limited, these tactics lay the groundwork for what larger units do. Buddies check each others backs, cover each other during movement and share target information. They are also responsible for bandaging each other until a medic becomes available. The individual roles are listed below.

##### Team Leader (TL)
As the name implies, the TL leads the fire team by controlling their fire and movement as well as communicating back to higher leadership. The TL also provides grenade launcher support to the team and is equipped with smoke, flare and HE rounds for flexibility. Initiative at lower levels can often change the outcome of large scale conflicts.

##### Rifleman Anti-Tank (RAT)
The RAT moves with the team leader as his buddy, and carries the primary anti-tank weapon of the fire team in the form of a shoulder-launched disposable rocket. Because of the importance of this one shot weapon, the RAT is generally the second most senior member of the team. The RAT primarily operates as a base level rifleman, like the AAR by covering sectors, laying down effective fire and flanking hostiles.  They typically drive the team transport vehicles and man the vehicle mounted weapons on armed versions.

##### Automatic Rifleman (AR)
An AR gunner provides the fire team with its primary source of anti-infantry firepower in the form of an automatic rifle, squad automatic weapon or light machine gun. With a longer, reinforced barrel and fed by either a large belt or large box magazine, the Automatic Rifleman provides sustained fire capabilities to the team.  It is the ARs job to engage and suppress enemy infantry, winning fire superiority so the team and squad can gain freedom of movement.  

##### Assistant Automatic Rifleman (AAR)
The AAR operates as the ARs buddy, feeding him both target locations and ammunition.  As these squad support weapons are intended to be used from supported positions or prone it can leave their buddy vulnerable from multiple directions and the AAR is vital to their security.  Combined this buddy team works as the fire teams primary means of winning medium to long range firefights as the AAR is equipped with a medium range optic to spot for both himself and the AR.

## Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- Listen to your team leader.
- Move with your buddy.
- When in doubt, mimic your teammates.
- Check your surroundings and understand the situation.
- Shoot out of cover from the right, you are less exposed this way.
  - or train yourself to switch shoulders every time.
- Communicate what you see and hear.
  - Call out what you KNOW, but avoid guessing as it leads to poor decision making.
- Use common sense.
- Take initiative within your own level.
  - A buddy team taking it on themselves to skip a platoon objective is not likely to go well for them.
- Grab your buddy, watch that sector that's been left open.
- Unless in combat, keep finger off of mouse 1 or have your weapon lowered.
- Give advice/opinion to team leader when called for.
  - During planning advice is welcome.
  - During Briefing is when you should be listening.
- Ask questions!

**DO NOT:**
- Backseat command.
- Leave your team.
- Lone Wolf.
- Disrespect team leadership.
- Disregard orders.
- Cause intentional team damage.
- Grab equipment without permission (mines, firearms, optics, vehicles, etc).

## SIGNALS

##### VISUAL COMMUNICATION

Standardized smoke signals allow for easy and reliable communications between various elements either in support of or in replace of radio traffic. Being able to wordlessly mark friendly positions and enemy positions in a very visible way allows elements to react faster and with more safety.

|**Color**| **Indication** |
|:-------:|:---------------|
| White   | Used for concealment almost exclusively. |
|         | May be used for other effects only if communicated through radio traffic. |
| Green   | Used for marking friendly locations for other units to avoid friendly fire incidents. |
|         | May also be used as a LZ marker if communicated with the pilot. |
| Red     | Used to mark enemy positions for fire support. |
| Blue    | Used as a LZ marker. |
| Purple  | Used by the medic for CASEVAC, concealment or priority support. |
|         | Always assist the purple smoke! |
| Yellow  | Not used / Enemy |
| Orange  | Sometimes used to mark paradropped supplies. |

##### RADIO COMMUNICATION
The unit uses a pre-designated signal code to simplify operations as every member knows what channel to be in at all times. This gives survivability to our radio network; with separate channels per section this keeps the chatter down, but should individual rifleman need to communicate for whatever reason, they know which channels to go to. We also make use of a simplified, standardized template for all communications between different units. This is to reduce the on-air time for each speaker, and to make the most of that time.

It is important that wither you are talking on command net or the section's personal net, you remember the ABCs of radio communication. Accuracy, Brevity and Clarity. If you need to take a few more seconds to think through your message before you send it, do so. Make sure you provide all the important information in as short a message as possible. This really comes into itself when issuing a contact report, which will be described below.

>Accuracy, Brevity and Clarity.

Radio communications via command net have a simple template to follow consisting of four parts that should be said in order. Message Recipient, Message Sender, Message, Ending. This is important, as you only spend the time to communicate your message once you've confirmed the recipient can hear you. For example, if Alpha 1 needs to inform platoon leadership about an enemy vehicle, it would go like this. "Command, Alpha 1. Vehicle contact, over." At this point you would wait for Command to answer your call before continuing. Alternatively, "Command, Alpha 1. Urgent message, over." would work as well.

>**You** from **Me**, Message, **Over**.

Communication on the squad level net is much less formal, but should only be used for critical information, or for communication between elements out of vocal range. "Hey Matt, shift your fire left, there's another guy behind the next bush" is perfectly acceptable on the squad net, but not on the command net. Buddy Teams should communicate to each other and the Team Leader through the squad net, leaving command net for more important squad to squad and platoon command needs.


## Battle Drills

Battle Drill 1 & 2 are examples of real tactics that are used consistently during missions. It is vital that team leaders have a firm understanding of these tactics, while everyone should know the basics in case of casualties involving the leadership. 

- Battle Drill 1 is a simple offensive plan, with our side firing the first shot. 
- Battle Drill 2 is nearly identical, however the enemy initiated the firefight. 

Battle Drills are simple in both concept and implementation, and can be done with Buddy Teams, or an entire platoon. They are meant to be simple and effective, conditioned into soldiers on the battlefield as muscle memory. 

##### Battle Drill 1

Battle Drill 1 takes two teams and designates one as the fire support element, and one as the assaulting element. The support group fixes the target with heavy, accurate shooting, while the assaulting element flanks **boldly** to the most covered or concealed flank. **Speed is life.**

As the assaulting element closes on the target, they can call for the support element to "shift fire". This means for them to move their suppressing fire to the opposite flank, to avoid friendly fire while keeping the target's heads down. 

The goal is to distract and disrupt the enemy with suppressive fire so that the flanking element can get into a position to destroy the enemy in-close.
