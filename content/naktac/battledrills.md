The idea behind a "battle drill" is that it is a standardized way to react to a common battlefield event. Battle drills ensure that everyone is on the same page of music, so to speak, and allows for a rapid reaction to an event with the minimum of orders needing to be issued.

Understand that simple drills and clear commands will have a disproportionate effect on outcomes. Effective battle drills will mean you have an instant PLAN which can be immediately modified by the tactical leader as necessary for the situation. Your immediate, disciplined response allows you to regain and retain the initiative.

The building block for battle drills are personal skills. Once mastered, team drills and SOPs can be accomplished.  Drills are the tools that leaders will combine and turn into tactics, in order to defeat the enemy.

The following battle drills cover the most common combat events to be encountered in Arma, and are the foundations on which additional tactics are built.

## General Measures
The following is a list of general measures an element can incorporate into their battle drills. This is organized into proactive measures for before contact is made and reactive measures when contact is taken.

- **Proactive**
  - Maintain constant 360 degree security / Situational Awareness
  - Limit exposure/stay in constant motion
  - Don't set patterns
  - Deny enemy use of overwatch/strategic terrain/advantages
  - Stick to shadows/use cover and concealment
  - Communicate ONLY important information.
  - Don't become complacent / relaxed in the field
  - Maintain good spacing
  - Leaders should blend into the element
  - Wear protective armor/use armored vehicles
  - Use optics to "outlook" the enemy
  - Use friendly assets for observation
  - Use small recon/security patrols
  - Have a plan and rehearse it

- **Reactive**
  - Take immediate cover/conceal your position
  - Obscure enemy field of view by using terrain to your advantage
  - Use smoke to obscure or distract enemy
  - Use whatever assets necessary to destroy the enemy. No honor in a gunfight
  - "Slice the pie" - reduce exposure
  - ID enemy location and return accurate and devastating fire
  - Maneuver on enemy & destroy him or break contact
  - Stay in the fight.  Use "Just enough medical".
  - Wounded troops apply "self aid" until fight is over
  - Reorganize/evacuate/treat casualties when suitable

## Drill Types

Battle Drill 1 & 2 are examples of real tactics that are used consistently during missions. It is vital that team leaders have a firm understanding of these tactics, while everyone should know the basics in case of casualties involving the leadership. 

- Battle Drill 1 is a simple offensive plan, with our side firing the first shot. 
- Battle Drill 2 is nearly identical, however the enemy initiated the firefight. 

Battle Drills are simple in both concept and implementation, and can be done with Buddy Teams, or an entire platoon. They are meant to be simple and effective, conditioned into soldiers on the battlefield as muscle memory.
