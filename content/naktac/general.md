5. If you know that you may need to be afk or leave early, you must inform your team leader and the Operation Leader before the mission starts so that they can plan accordingly.
6. Do not needlessly disrupt those who are leading the mission or conducting planning and preparation.

# Planning
1. The planning phase starts 20 minutes before the mission start time, or when an Operation Leader is present, whichever is earlier. If there is no Operation Leader selected at the start of the planning phase, one will be selected at random from the qualified players.
