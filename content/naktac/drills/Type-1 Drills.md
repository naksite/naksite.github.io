## Battle Drill 1: Conducting an Assault
- Battle Drill 1 is a simple offensive plan, with our side firing the first shot. 
The most planned battle drill is a simple assault or flanking assault. Nearly all assault plans are based off the guiding principle that once the assault begins, there is no fire without movement and there is no movement without fire. Violent action alone does not take ground in a meaningful way and neither does moving through it without dominating that territory. One or more elements maneuver into a superior assaulting position while one or more elements engage and suppress the assault target. Repeat until objectives are complete.

##### General Fundamental Principles
1. There is no fire without movement
    - As soon as the shooting starts, someone needs to be moving
2. Do not give up territory
    - While assaulting, make certain the area is cleared of hostiles and they are unable to return
3. Communicate effectively
    - Assault teams and support teams need to communicate to prevent friendly fire
4. Press the assault until no longer possible
    - Then switch to support so other teams can continue the assault

### Support by Fire / Flanking Assault
An assault takes two teams and designates one as the fire support element, and one as the assaulting element. The support group fixes the target with heavy, accurate shooting, while the assaulting element flanks **boldly** to the most covered or concealed flank. **Speed is life.**

As the assaulting element closes on the target, they can call for the support element to "shift fire". This means for them to move their suppressing fire to the opposite flank, to avoid friendly fire while keeping the target's heads down. 

The goal is to distract and disrupt the enemy with suppressive fire so that the flanking element can get into a position to destroy the enemy in-close. 

### Assaulting a bunker or fortification
Bunkers are a means by which a prepared infantry force can more strongly defend a location. Characteristic of a bunker are sturdy walls which provide significant protection from direct and indirect fire - sandbags, reinforced concrete, or similar - as well as apertures from which occupants can fire out. Bunkers are often mutually-supporting, with covered or concealed routes leading from one position to another, with bunkers able to cover each other from close assault, and many are camouflaged to make them difficult to spot in advance of them opening fire. If not properly approached, a single well-placed bunker can wreak havoc on friendly forces. Bear in mind that a bunker may contain more than just light infantry weapons - some conceal heavy machineguns, grenade machineguns, anti-tank missiles, or anti-aircraft cannons. A well-integrated bunker complex will have a mix of anti-infantry and anti-vehicle weaponry and should be approached and attacked with great caution and planning.

The toughest bunkers take the form of elevated modular metal/concrete structures intended to act as both observation posts and fighting positions. These come in a variety of forms and sizes, but characteristic amongst them are windows that can be closed to provide greater protection to those inside.

These bunkers can be particularly difficult to defeat due to their elevated nature and strong armor.

Regardless of whether you're dealing with a large tower or smaller earthen bunker, the process for destroying one is as follows.

1. First, you must restrict the bunker’s ability to see, which in turn makes them unable to fire effectively. This can be done through two methods – the first is to mass fires at the bunker’s apertures, forcing the occupants to duck or otherwise take cover. When possible, underbarrel grenade launchers or anti-tank rockets can be fired into the apertures, with the hopes that they’ll burst off of an interior wall and kill or incapacitate some of the occupants. This method is expensive from an ammo standpoint and not always effective depending on weapons available as well as the range from the bunker. The next, and more effective method, is to employ smoke to mask the bunker’s field of view. Smoke can be launched via underbarrel grenade launchers, thrown by hand when at closer ranges, or fired from mortars. Depending on the type of bunker, smoke can either land near the apertures or it may be necessary to fire it inside the bunker itself, such as when dealing with elevated defenses.
2. Once the bunker’s vision is obscured or the occupants are suppressed, troops move towards the flanks of the bunker in order to work around behind it while staying out of the firing arcs. Approaching from the front of the bunker – even when it’s smoked or suppressed – is generally discouraged, as smoke can blow away or occupants can become bold unexpectedly. Once troops have closed with the bunker, grenades can be thrown into it. Depending on the size and composition of the bunker, this may or may not be effective. If available, flame units – flamethrowers or napalm projectors, incendiary grenades, etc – can be fired or thrown into the bunker to clear it out. Satchel charges can also be used to attempt to collapse or otherwise destroy the bunker from the exterior - particularly useful when dealing with elevated bunkers that would otherwise require fighting up staircases to clear out.

When all other options have been exhausted, troops must enter into the bunker and engage the occupants in close quarters battle. This sort of combat is incredibly dangerous to the attacking force and must be carefully considered. Whenever possible, attempt to reduce bunkers by external means – throwing in explosives, calling in tanks or other armored support, burning them down, etc.

Keep in mind that a proper defense will employ the concept of mutual support – which is to say that any given bunker will be covered by another bunker in another position. It will often be necessary to smoke multiple bunkers at the same time to negate this advantage, or even assault multiple bunkers simultaneously.

### Conducting an Ambush

An ambush is defined in the US Army's "Infantry Platoon and Rifle Squad" publication as "...a surprise attack by fire from concealed positions on a moving or temporarily halted enemy unit. It combines the advantages and characteristics of the offense with those of the defense."
​
Ambushes are an extremely favorable way to engage the enemy. The combination of surprise and fierce, accurate fire can rip an enemy element to pieces before they have time to react.

#### Types of Ambushes
There are three main types of ambushes for our purposes - the deliberate one, in which you know that an enemy force is going to be moving through a given area, the hasty one, in which we unexpectedly have an opportunity to ambush an enemy force that has not detected us, and the delaying or guerrilla one, in which we are attempting to strike the enemy, cause casualties and confusion, and they withdraw before they can retaliate.

##### Deliberate Ambush
​These are typically convoy ambushes. You may be tasked in a mission to stake out a slice of terrain and cover roads that an enemy convoy is expected to pass. In such a situation, demolition plays a large part. Mines can be set, as can satchel charges and other explosive devices. A relatively large amount of prep time is given for this, and the results tend to reflect this. Deliberate ambushes are devastating and highly effective. The one big unknown is whether the expected enemy force will be the same composition and size as our mission briefing or intelligence reported. The difference between a troop convoy and a tank convoy, for instance, is huge, and both must be engaged with different tactical considerations.

##### Hasty Ambush
​Hasty ambushes are usually against enemy infantry but can also be against other enemy forces. The decision to conduct a hasty ambush needs to be communicated rapidly, since there usually isn't much time to get positioned and ready to open fire. Fireteam leaders and squad leaders are the most common leaders to give orders for a hasty ambush. Satchel charges and other explosives play a very limited role in these types of ambushes due to the lack of time and ability to position them.

##### Delaying Ambush / Guerrilla Ambush
Delaying or guerrilla ambushes work best against enemy infantry. The purpose of them is to either delay the enemy's pursuit of friendly forces during a withdrawal or sow confusion and death amid their ranks unexpectedly before vanishing. The size of an ambush team of this nature is usually a squad or less.

The goal of a delaying ambush is to engage the enemy by fire and cause enough casualties to temporarily halt them. At that point, the team withdraws to another defensive position from which they repeat the ambush if possible.

The goal of a guerrilla ambush, on the other hand, is to engage the enemy by fire, cause casualties, and withdraw before the enemy can decisively respond to the ambush team and fix them. The guerrilla ambush team breaks contact, maneuvers to lose any pursuit from the enemy, and then evaluates its next moves.

Both of these ambush teams must be able to engage the enemy, produce the desired effect, and relocate or disengage before enemy support assets such as artillery or close air support can be brought to bear.

#### Key Elements of an Ambush
The key elements of any ambush are friendly positioning, location of the kill zone, and proper initiation of fires.

 - Friendly Positioning. The best ambushes have the friendly forces located in good cover and concealment, firing from an elevated position. This makes it the most difficult for the ambushed enemy to be able to effectively retaliate.
 - Location of the Kill Zone. The kill zone is the area in which fire is focused at the initiation of the ambush. An ideal kill zone has very little cover or concealment, and no significant terrain features that might cause "dead zones" to exist. A kill zone should be well-covered by friendly lines of fire, and any potential exits from it should be able to be fired at/into without friendly forces shifting positions. Grenadiers should ensure that any "dead space" or obvious cover or concealment can be easily be taken under fire with their grenades and position themselves accordingly.
 - Proper Initiation of Fires. The signal to start the ambush is usually given verbally by the element leader (ie squad leader). He will give a warning that the ambush is about to begin, so that everyone can sight in on targets and prepare to fire. Once the order is given, all friendlies should begin firing a heavy and accurate volume of fire into the kill zone. Continue firing until all enemies are confirmed dead or the element leader gives a command to shift or cease fire. One special consideration must be made clear for ambushes - if a friendly accidentally fires before the element leader, the ambush is initiated whether it should have been or not. All players must immediately open fire in such a situation to try to salvage as much of the surprise and lethality as possible. One must also keep in mind that a player may hastily fire on an enemy who has spotted the ambush group, in which case he may not have time to announce what is happening and must rely on his teammates to immediately begin firing on their targets as well. Because of both of these situations, every member of an ambush team must be ready to initiate fires either at the element leader's verbal command or the sudden firing of any member of the ambush party.

Players must also consider the use of explosives devices like satchel charges and claymore mines. These are usually not practical for a hasty ambush, but a vehicle ambush or deliberate ambush can benefit greatly from their usage. Triggering explosives to start an ambush is very effective, as it adds an extra layer of shock and confusion to the situation for the enemy.

#### Formations of an Ambush

##### The Linear Ambush
A linear ambush is the most basic type. In it, all ambushing forces are arrayed in a single line. This type of ambush is easy to set up in a hurry and works well in most situations. Many hasty ambushes end up as linear ambushes due to lack of time and mobility to get an L-shaped ambush enacted. Note that the longer the line is, the harder it is for the enemy to find cover or concealment - features that may conceal him from one end of the line may not have an effect due to a member on the other end being able to still see him. Note also that the ambushing team should not be spread so thin that the ambushees are able to assault into the ambush and drive a wedge through the line.

##### The L-Shaped Ambush
An L-shaped ambush is a bit more complex to pull off, but the extra effort is rewarded by markedly increased effectiveness. An L-shaped ambush requires that one element be positioned at a right-angle to the rest of the ambush. When the ambush is initiated, one of the two elements will find itself firing into the flanks of the enemy, while the other element will be firing into its front. Being hit from two sides like this will rapidly attrit the enemy and make it almost impossible for them to survive. A well-conducted L-shaped ambush is near certain death for those trapped in the kill zone.
​
L-Shaped ambushes can be done with any composition of forces. Even a single infantryman who is off to the side of the enemy when they come under fire from the front can have a dramatic effect. Initiating fires from the front while a sniper or designated marksman lurks quietly off to the enemy's flank can be highly effective - the enemy will find cover or concealment that protects them from the front, leaving their flanks open to the sniper or designated marksman who can then pick them off at will.

##### The Convoy/Vehicle Ambush
Vehicle/convoy ambushes are similar to infantry ambushes, with the main difference being that the vehicles are able to exit the kill zone rapidly if nothing is done to stop them, and armored vehicles can quickly turn the tides by attacking into the ambush if they are not rapidly dealt with.
Special Guidelines for a Vehicle/Convoy Ambush

 - When ambushing soft vehicles, shoot for the tires and drivers. Flat tires make it almost impossible to move with any decent speed. Dead drivers add confusion to the mix, and require that someone get out of the vehicle and then back in as a driver to continue on. Doing that effectively under fire without having your head shot off is difficult at best.
 - Hit the lead vehicle first, then the trail vehicle, then work up and down the rest of the convoy. Stopping the lead vehicle with fire can cause the rest of the convoy to temporarily halt and compress until the convoy can make the combat decision to drive around the disabled vehicle. Taking out the trailing vehicle can prevent the convoy from reversing out of the kill zone. This is more pronounced the tighter the terrain is. Trying to block in a convoy like this in the open desert may not work well, but in a constricted valley or urban environment it will be more effective.
 - Take out other vehicles in order based on the threat they pose. If there is armor in the convoy, ensure that it is taken out immediately or else the enemy will likely be able to use it to fight free of the kill zone.
 - When numbers allow for it, "double up" anti-tank gunners on each target. One AT should fire his weapon at a tank or other piece of armor, with the other AT gunner standing by to take a shot if the first misses.
 - Stay away from knocked-out vehicles. Secondary explosions in Arma can wipe out infantry with ease. Flames from the wreckage can also cause damage.
 - Decoy devices can be used to halt a convoy in a kill zone. Placing an abandoned vehicle in the middle of a road can oftentimes cause a convoy to slow down or halt if they suspect that the vehicle is hiding an IED or satchel charge. To take advantage of this precaution, place IEDs or satchel charges further up the road and then place the vehicle in a position such that the convoy will stop upon seeing the vehicle, and upon stopping they will be in the kill radius of the explosives you hid along the road, not to mention that they will also be in the kill zone of friendly infantry positioned to overwatch the explosives.
