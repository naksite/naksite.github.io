## Battle Drill 2: Reaction to Contact / Reaction to Enemy Fire
- Battle Drill 2 is nearly identical, however the enemy initiated the firefight. 

The most fundamental battle drill is reacting to enemy fire. It forms the basis for many of the other tactics covered in this guide, and these guidelines should be kept in mind when reading about them and applied as necessary. 
<!-- more -->
#### General Fundamental Principles
1. React immediately
    - Return fire
    - Communicate
    - Seek cover
    - All at the same time!
2. Win the firefight
    - Don't stop fighting expecting something to change
3. Communicate effectively
    - Make sure you continue to communicate what you see and hear
    - Make sure what you communicate is useful and terse
4. In contact; no movement without covering fire
    - Just because you didn't start the fight doesn't mean you can't have a supporting element
5. Attack from the flank where possible
    - Just because you didn't start the fight doesn't mean you can't turn it into an assault

#### Communicating Contact
The way to communicate in a reaction to contact scenario is done by using a procedure called the 3 D’s. This procedure helps friendly forces identify enemy positions and effectively engage the threat. The 3 D’s are as follows.

1. Direction – The direction of the contact, using any orientation technique.​ ​
2. Distance – Distance from the contact, may be calculated using visual cues or the crack-bang method.​
3. Description – A quick description of the target and their surroundings. This helps the team identify the target.

Give the most basic information first and come back with more detail later if needed.  Direction is often enough if the targets are anticipated.  But detailed descriptions of the hiding places of sharpshooters or hidden emplacements might be necessary after everyone takes cover.

#### ​Example of Typical React to Contact Flows
1. Receive Enemy Fire > Return Fire > Take Cover > Return Appropriate Fire > Move onto Appropriate Battle Drill.
2. Receive Enemy Fire > (enemy not seen) > Take Cover > Return Appropriate Fire > Move onto Appropriate Battle Drill.
3. Receive Enemy Fire > (enemy fire too severe) > Take Cover > Return Appropriate Fire > Move onto Appropriate Battle Drill

#### Leadership Responsibilities
If your element comes under fire, follow these basic guidelines, depending on what level of leadership you're at.

##### Fireteam Member
1. Make a hasty contact report (ie "Contact left!") while you move to take up as good of a position as possible (prioritize cover, only go for concealment if no cover is available) and scan for signs of the enemy as you return fire in the direction of the enemy. This process is known as ALERT - COVER - SCAN - ENGAGE, and one must remember that each step is happening more or less simultaneously with the others. This is further broken down for simplicity.
    1. Make a hasty contact report (Alert/Orient)
    2. Take immediate cover or concealment
    3. Scan for signs of the enemy
    4. Return fire in the direction of the enemy
​2. Listen for orders from the fireteam leader or squad leader. If your element leader is killed, and you are next in command, take command and evaluate the situation as a fireteam leader would (see next section).
​3. Continue scanning for, engaging, and communicating the location of known, suspected, and likely enemy positions. Ten seconds into the firefight, you will likely have a much better feel for what is happening and where the enemy is. Ensure that you continue to communicate this information to your team and squad members.
4. Scan all around - just because the enemy is firing from one particular area does not mean that they aren't already flanking or positioned in other, dramatically different locations as well. Do not fall prey to tunnel vision!
5. Don't be afraid to show disciplined initiative. Fireteam members are at the cutting edge of the battle. If you see an opportunity or a danger, take the initiative to do or say something about it. This includes seeing or hearing evidence of enemy armor coming. If out in the open, for instance, a fireteam member may announce this to his team and thus get them moving towards better cover instead of staying in place and being caught in an even worse position.
6. If wounded, announce it and make your way to the medic if the wound is dire. If it's a light wound, continue fighting until things calm down.

##### Fireteam Leader
1. Ensure that your fireteam has positioned itself appropriately, and if not, order them to a covered or concealed position. Read the terrain, think about dead ground (defilade), cover from view and fire. If necessary due to bad positioning, deploy smoke and pull your team back to better cover or concealment. 
2. Determine the location of the enemy as precisely as possible and report it to the squad leader. Anticipate the enemy. Quickly read the terrain in conjunction with the relative positions and strength of enemy and friendly forces.
3. Begin engaging the enemy yourself. Use your underbarrel grenade launcher against clusters of the enemy and high-value targets and use the rifle against individual soldiers. Stay tactically alert and avoid getting tunnel vision.
4. Direct the fire of your team as needed. Give quick orders, based on tactics and drills. This includes massing fire on specific targets or covering a very specific sector. 
5. Be prepared to maneuver in accordance with your squad leader's orders. Scan the area and consider how and where you might move to gain a tactical advantage over the enemy. Constantly think about what if's and 'Actions On.'

##### Squad Leader
1. Achieve fire superiority. If the enemy opens an ambush with an automatic rifle and rifle fire, pour more fire on his position than he is putting on you. The sheer volume of return fire you direct at the enemy may be the deciding factor of the firefight from a psychological standpoint.
2. Ensure that the fireteams are reacting appropriately. If necessary, order them around to achieve a more effective posture or maximize fires in one direction. If one team is particularly exposed, direct the other teams to increase fire while the exposed team moves to a better position.
3. Report to the platoon commander and tell him what the situation is when time and the situation permits. This should be brief - "Alpha squad taking heavy fire from our East". Prioritize appropriately - if you need to be communicating with your squad to keep them alive instead of spending time reporting up the chain, do so, and worry about telling the PltCo once things have calmed down a bit.
4. Assess the situation. Can your squad fight from where you are now? If not, direct your fireteams to new positions, moving via bounding overwatch so that you maintain fire on the enemy at all times. If you can fight from your current position, do so and act as a base-of-fire element for the platoon. If you cannot fight from your position and cannot move to a more favorable one, execute a "Break Contact" drill (as described below).
5. Coordinate with neighboring squads if possible. If a nearby squad is in position to exploit the enemy's vulnerability, pass your thoughts to them and see if they can do anything about it.
6. Listen for orders from the platoon commander.
7. Maintain situational awareness. Stay alert for possible flanking attacks.
8. Ensure that the Squad Medic is taking care of casualties as they occur.

### Reaction to Enemy Fire

##### Assault Through
Picture

Assault Through is a technique in which an element assaults an enemy force or position with aggressive & violent action. Fire & movement tactics are used to ensure that a steady volume of fire is put on the enemy location(s) during the assault. This helps to keep the enemy's head down and prevents them from keeping friendly forces decisively engaged. This may be used in a situation such as an ambush or react to contact scenario where shock-and-awe tactics are more favorable than breaking contact.

An Assault Through technique is a rapid assault maneuver that is typically done in a line or wedge formation. It is designed to quickly close with and destroy an enemy force.​ To execute an Assault Through drill, follow the steps below.

1. The element leader will announce to his team his intent to assault through. He will communicate this via radio and tell his element to "prepare for assault".
​2. All element members will prepare to assault through. ​All element members will perform a reload if required and then announce that they are "set" via radio to let the element leader know they are ready to begin the assault. 
3. After a brief pause, the element leader will call out “Assault Through". Once this is announced, the entire element will begin quickly moving in a line or wedge formation and engage the enemy at close distance. Prior to the actual assault, it may be feasible for members of the element to throw lethal or non-lethal grenades towards the direction of the enemy, often done in a simultaneous fashion. This may be done to quickly disorient, disrupt and destroy the enemy before the assault happens to ensure maximum effectiveness.
4. After engaging the enemy and reaching their position, the element leader will then announce to either push through or withdraw. From here, the element will either continue with the assault past the enemy's position or withdraw from the area. If withdrawing, the element initiates a break contact drill.
5. If pushing though, the element will move past the original position, where the element leader will announce for his element to hold. After about fifty or so meters, the element will hold where all players will go firm, move to cover/concealment, lower profile and continue providing security.
6. Following the assault, the element leader may call in for an ACE report and then proceed with the mission.

##### Breaking Contact/Withdrawing
Breaking contact is the means by which an element disengages from a confrontation with an enemy force in an orderly fashion. Fire & maneuver tactics are used to ensure that a steady volume of fire is put on the enemy location(s) during the withdrawal. This helps to keep the enemy's head down and prevents them from keeping friendly forces decisively engaged.
​
Breaking contact is basically an assault done in reverse.

Picture

The primary method of breaking contact is via Bounding. This is also known as 'Thinning the Lines' or 'Reverse Leapfrogging'. With the former applying to individual players, while the latter applies to elements. This is best executed when the element in contact has weapon systems that provide good fire superiority.

To execute a "Break Contact via Bounding" drill, the following steps are taken:

1. The element leader announces his intent to "Break Contact via Bounding". He may designate one or more elements as the "base of fire" or "covering" element. This element can be as small as a single member or may consist of multiple fireteams or squads when employed at the platoon level. 
2. The covering element takes the best hasty position possible and begins laying fire on the enemy. Oftentimes the base of fire element will be chosen based on already having a good position, making additional movement unnecessary. 
3. While the covering element lays down sustained accurate fire on the enemy, other elements move via rushes to the rear. Movement should start with the elements closest to the enemy if feasible. These elements pick spots of natural or artificial cover or concealment from which they can support the base of fire element when it pulls back. Smoke is deployed to conceal movement when available.
4. On the element leader's command, or at their discretion, the base of fire displaces to the rear towards the supporting elements. These supporting elements begin sustained accurate firing on the enemy until the base of fire element has moved past them and established a new position.
5. This process is repeated as necessary until friendly forces have successfully disengaged from enemy contact.
6. Once successfully withdrawn, the element members will call "All Set". The element will then go firm, establish a situation report and then the element leader will designate a direction of travel offline of the original bounding direction and then proceed to head out.

##### Element Withdrawal
An element withdrawal is used to create distance between the enemy and the unit in a simultaneous fashion. This is best accomplished via line or wedge formation. ​

1. Upon taking contact, the element leader will announce his intent for an element withdrawal. From there, the element will attempt to form a line or wedge formation and begin returning fire toward the enemy.
2. The element leader will then address the direction, elements to move and bounds or other movements. Upon receiving the order to move the elements moving will communicate that they are moving and will begin to retreat quickly. Typically, 3-5 seconds rushes to move to a better position are ideal and each movement should be no more than 50 meters. Once the moving elements are set, they will communicate this to their team & begin to engage the enemy.
3. This process is repeated until everyone has withdrawn from their original position. At this point the element may continue their withdrawal from the engagement.

### Reaction to Ambush
An ambush typically is a more coordinated enemy effort than your average "meeting engagement" firefight. The 'kill zone' (where the enemy focuses their fires) is under heavy, concentrated fire, and those within it have to rapidly react to the situation if they hope to survive.
​
The reaction to an ambush depends on whether it is a 'near' or 'far' ambush. Both will be described below. The guidelines above for a general "Reaction to Contact" should be kept in mind as well.

##### Near Ambush
A 'near ambush' is defined as an ambush occurring with the enemy within grenade-throwing distance.
When an element is subjected to a 'near ambush', the action required varies depending on whether any given player is in the "kill zone" or outside of it. The voice call for a near ambush is simply "Near ambush, (direction), and should be said by the first person to identify it. Due to the confusion caused by a near ambush, the element will likely require a moment to identify the type of ambush. This means that you'll likely hear a "Contact (direction)!" call, followed by "Near ambush!" after a brief pause. Throw grenades if you can't see them; shoot otherwise.
​
If you are in the kill zone (meaning, the enemy is focusing the bulk of their fire in your area), you must immediately return fire and take up covered or concealed positions. Immediately throw frag grenades or smoke at the enemy and assault their position once the grenades have exploded or the smoke has formed. The speed and violence of your element's reaction to the ambush will be the deciding factor as to how many of you walk away from it.

If you are not in the kill zone, your job becomes one of support. Identify and engage the enemy with as much firepower as you can bring to bear, as quickly as possible. When the "kill zone" element assaults into the ambush, shift or cease fire to avoid friendly fire.

##### Far Ambush
A 'far ambush', on the other hand, is any ambush in which the enemy is further than 50 meters away. These can take a multitude of forms, and the only positive aspect of them is that the increased distance of the enemy means that friendly forces can potentially maneuver better and the enemy may not be as deadly with their fire from an extended range.
​
Again, the action of each individual varies depending on their location within or outside of the "kill zone". The voice call for this is "Far ambush, (direction)". In practical usage, this will most likely simply be called as a normal contact report, and it will be up to the element leader to determine whether it's a meeting engagement or an actual deliberate ambush.

If you are in the kill zone, immediately return fire and move to a covered or concealed position. Focus fires on enemy crew-served or high-volume weapons (machineguns) and try to knock them out as quickly as possible. Smoke grenades (both UGL and hand-thrown) can be used in two primary fashions - the first is to place them around the "kill zone" ambushed squad to conceal them from enemy fire. The other use, for the UGL smoke grenades, is to fire them at the enemy location and try to obscure their view of friendly forces.

In a far ambush, the ambushed element does not attempt to assault through the ambush. Instead, they form a base of fire while the elements not in the kill zone maneuver against the ambushing enemy force. Once the maneuvering team begins to assault the enemy ambush team, the base of fire team should shift or cease fire to avoid friendly casualties.

If you are not in the kill zone, your job is to flank and knock out the enemy ambush element. You should move with your element via covered/concealed routes when possible and try to work your way onto a vulnerable enemy flank. Ensure that you notify the base-of-fire element when you begin the close assault on the enemy to avoid friendly-fire.

Although being able to fight off an ambush is possible, it is something that should be avoided entirely. As the saying goes, the best defense against an ambush is not to be in one. There are measures your element can take that will decrease the possibility of walking into an ambush. Remember, the same key terrain that looks appealing to you to setup an ambush in are likely the same ones the enemy will be looking at as well.

 - Study your current intel to pick your routes wisely.
 - Vary your routes. Don't take the same path back that you went out on.
 - Stay off heavily travelled and defined trails. Humans are lazy by nature and tend to take pathways of least resistance, thus the enemy will most likely setup ambushes along these paths.
 - Try to be unexpected and move through areas that offer the most cover or concealment. 
 - Be cautious of danger areas. Avoid them as much as possible as these provide clear fields of fire and observation for the enemy. Don't be afraid of going around or getting wet, this may be unpopular with your troops but it will keep them alive. If danger areas have to be crossed, make sure you have a system for crossing that is well-rehearsed with your element, such as placing near and far side security before sending others across. Regardless of this fact, it is still entirely possible to be blindsided by a well prepared enemy ambush.

### Reaction to Sniper Fire
If an element receives sniper fire during a mission, the reaction to it will depend upon the assets available, the terrain, and the overall mission.

The effectiveness of a sniper is inversely proportional to how knowledgeable players are in counter-sniper and reaction-to-sniper drills. A 'green' group can find themselves pinned down by one, whereas an experienced group will be able to utilize proper movement techniques, smoke, and organic and non-organic assets to find, fix & suppress, and ultimately kill or bypass the sniper.

Why an enemy may employ snipers? Can be done for physiological warfare, area deniability, targeting and acquisition of your assets and Directing indirect fire assets.

What problems do they pose for the infantry? Delays in mission schedule, rerouting of forces and possible low morale so lack of movement ensues.

Where do snipers commonly hide? The first thought is high in windows or in large bushes, yes but also no. Snipers are smart and usually work in small elements so their signature is vastly small compared to a squad of infantry. Snipers are not bound to just rural or urban areas…expect them anywhere.
Through lessons learned snipers hide:

 - Broken down vehicles
 - Recessed in to shadowed areas
 - Offset buildings to your mission objective
 - From areas you’re unable to attack due to ROE (churches and hospitals for example)
 - Low lying brush/vegetation adjacent to areas of importance
 - Military crests of hills

What weapons do enemy snipers use? Mainly weapons of a high caliber and range (7.62x54R for example out of an SVD). Magnified optics even on basic infantry weapons (Scoped AKM). Some are merely snipers based upon position and angle of attack.

How to find a sniper? Look for misplaced vegetation, odd holes in buildings and items placed in areas they shouldn’t be (like a crate in the middle of a street). 
​
The basic things to keep in mind when dealing with snipers are as follows:
##### Individual Reaction to a Sniper
1. If a friendly is shot beside you, the first thing you should be thinking about (while moving to make yourself a hard target) is "Where did that shot come from?". If you know, immediately move to put some sort of hard cover (preferably) or put some good concealment between you and the enemy sniper. If you don't know, make an educated guess and find cover or concealment, then assess the situation.
2. If you recognize the distinctive 'crack!' of a sniper rifle or suspect that it is a sniper engaging you, shout "Sniper!" over direct speaking as you move to cover or concealment.
3. If you're out in the open, keep moving, and move unpredictably. Depending on how far away the sniper is, and the type of weapon he is using (ie bolt-action compared to semi-auto), he will probably wait for 'high-probability' shots. This means he wants to catch someone who is stationary or moving directly towards or away from him who is presenting a large profile. Low-probability shots (such as high deflection, limited exposure, or erratic target movement) will typically only be taken when the situation is desperate, the sniper is at close range, or when the sniper has a semi-automatic rifle like the SVD Dragunov. 
4. Once you're in cover, relay the position of enemy snipers or sharpshooters to other friendly forces to help to minimize casualties. Marking their position on the map is a good way to give friendly units an idea of where they should expect to find the shooter.  If you can’t identify, report the area you're in and send to a higher element to try to bypass.
5. Use the heaviest asset available to kill the sniper. If you have artillery, call it on the suspected sniper position. If you have mortars, set them up somewhere safe and pound the sniper position. If you have any kind of protected armor (ie IFV, MRAP, tank, etc), use it to flush out and kill the sniper. Ditto with aircraft. The last resort is infantry working as a cohesive team. Employ modified battle drills and report to a higher element so a friendly sniper team, if available, can respond. Infantry will typically take casualties when hunting down a sniper, so if it can be done any other way, it should be. If enemy fire is too intense, deploy smoke and suppressive fire in the suspected area and break contact.
##### Tips for Dealing with Snipers
 - Teamwork kills snipers. Individuals do not. Remember that you are part of a team, and that that team can help extricate you from situations that you cannot get out of yourself. You will almost never be able to out-shoot a good sniper by yourself. Instead, work with your team to suppress the sniper (if feasible) and then flank them. If you cannot realistically flank or otherwise reach the sniper, adapt your movement techniques to try to minimize the threat posed by him.
 - If you peek, keep it short. If you must look in the direction of the sniper and expose yourself, do so as carefully as possible. This means that you should utilize leaning, and should only peek out for a very brief period of time - half a second to one second is fairly safe. Because of the range and aiming precision required to make a kill shot, a sniper typically will require a second or two to sight in on an exposed target, compensate for drop, and fire the shot - at which point it may take another second for the bullet to travel the distance. Try to keep in mind that many people have caught a bullet in their forehead because they thought they could peek safely for "just a second longer".
 - Never peek from the same place twice. Snipers will frequently sight in on the area a person peeked from, and if they pop up from the same spot a second time, the chances of the sniper hitting them increase dramatically. If you have to peek, be unpredictable. Stand up and peek around a wall. Next time, crouch and peek. Peek around different corners. Et cetera. Don't establish a pattern, and make full use of the stance adjustment system. Going into a sideways prone crawl can allow you to look around obstacles while presenting an incredibly small target.
 - Smoke if you've got it. Proper application of smoke can give you just enough concealment to extricate yourself from a tough situation. Throw smoke in such a way that it conceals the way you're intending to run, and not just the position you're currently at. If you are hiding behind a small obstacle that is giving you cover, you don't need the smoke's concealment on your position, but you will need it when you run.
 - Use the crack/bang method to locate the sniper. Thanks to the modeling of supersonic bullet 'crack' and the speed of sound, the real-world "crack/bang" method can be used to locate an enemy sniper. In this, you listen for the crack of the bullet passing, followed by the bang of the muzzle blast. Utilizing the knowledge of round impacts, sonic crack and muzzle report help drastically when looking for the shooter. The time interval between these two events gives you an idea of the range of the shooter - if it's a long delay, the shooter is quite far away, roughly 700m or more. If it's a medium delay, they're probably at normal sniping range - say, 500 meters or so. If it's a short delay, they're within that. After hearing the crack of the bullet passing you can also turn yourself so that you pick up what specific direction the muzzle blast comes from. In order to calculate the actual distance, you must wait to hear either the round impact or sonic crack and then begin counting by seconds. Once you hear the crack, start immediately counting; when you hear the muzzle report you then stop counting and multiply the time counted by 300, that will give you an approximate distance to the target.

### Reaction to Air Attack

##### General
Coming under air attack as an infantry force is a serious issue, compounded more so if your unit does not have any organic air defense assets. You must know how to avoid being spotted by an enemy air asset, and if spotted, how to react.

 - If you hear the sound of a jet or helicopter coming in the direction of friendly forces, call it out over the radio (Helo inbound NW!) to alert other units.
 - If the aircraft does not know your position and is just scouting, the best course of action is to move the unit into concealment and wait until it has passed.
 - Minimize movement when the aircraft is near, as this makes it harder for the crew to spot camouflaged troops.
 - If the aircraft does spot your element, ensure that everyone spreads out and avoids bunching up. This will minimize the effects of the enemy weapon systems such as FFARs.
 - Assess the terrain and situation and prepare to move. You will want to head for terrain that will minimize the effects of the aircraft. Move into dense trees/forests, urban terrain, or try to get into a valley or on the reverse slope of a hill to reduce the angles that the aircraft can attack from.
 - Avoid firing on the aircraft with small-arms unless absolutely necessary. This typically only alerts them to your position and is generally ineffective unless massed against helicopters.

##### Rotary-Wing (Helos)
Helicopters are the most dangerous CAS aircraft in most situations. Their ability to loiter over the battlefield and deliver precision anti-tank, cannon, and rocket fire makes them a threat that should never be underestimated.

If helicopters are a known threat, all efforts should be made to avoid detection by them. This is done primarily via intelligent movement routes and techniques which prevent the enemy helo from being able to visually acquire friendly elements. Stay low, stay concealed, and move via concealed routes whenever possible.
​
If anti-air defense is organic to friendly forces, a sharp eye and ear must be kept for the approach of enemy helicopters. With proper warning, a helo can be brought down by MANPAD missiles before it knows what is happening.

If anti-air defense is not available to friendly forces, the best method is to avoid detection entirely. The only other defenses infantry have is via the massing of fires from machineguns, rifles, and anti-tank rockets or missiles. Helicopters that are oblivious to infantry presence and believe themselves to be safe will occasionally go low and slow enough to be accurately engaged by anti-tank rockets. If the opportunity presents itself, it should be taken, but ONLY if the anti-tank gunner is >90% positive he will successfully make the shot.

##### Fixed-Wing (Jets)
The main thing to remember when being attacked by jets is that movement perpendicular to the line of attack works best. This is especially true if they are strafing you with cannon fire or attacking with rockets. Another good thing to do is get on the reverse slope of a hill, and whenever the aircraft makes a pass, adjust your position so that you're once again on the far side of the hill relative to it.
​
The primary weakness of jet attack aircraft is the difficulty they have in picking out infantry at the speeds they fly. Thus, cover and concealment have a pronounced effect against them compared to rotary-wing aircraft. Unfortunately for infantry, jets tend to have extremely powerful weapons with wide areas of effect. The best defense is simply to not draw their wrath in the first place.

### Reaction to Indirect Fire
There are a few basic tips for how to act when coming under artillery attack or other indirect fire.

- Stay alert and know what to listen for. You may be able to hear the artillery unit firing in the distance before the rounds have impacted. This is most likely if you're being fired on by mortars or high-angle artillery fire. You may even hear the rounds coming in if they're subsonic. Other types of artillery will explode amongst your forces without warning and will likely catch everyone by surprise.
- Call out "Incoming!" as soon as you suspect that artillery is being fired on your position. The rule of thumb here is that it's better to be safe than sorry.
- If you're defending a location and cannot stray far, spread out and take the best cover you can find. Keep your eyes open for enemy infantry closing in under the cover of the barrage.
- If you're moving in the wild when the artillery comes in, follow your element leader and listen to his guidance. He will tell you a direction to run to get out of the impact area. Once clear, regroup with your element and continue on.

Enemy artillery can be taken out by counter-battery fire or close air support, if available, while mortar positions (which are usually much closer) can sometimes be assaulted and captured by ground attack.

Triangulation can be used to figure out the enemy positions - if two squads are separated by a good distance and can hear the firing artillery, compass bearings can be taken by each unit and then compared to get a fix on the likely location of the artillery.
​
Bear in mind that artillery units will often use a technique where they fire a barrage, wait, then fire another barrage. The idea is to make the unit being attacked think that the artillery is over, move out from cover, and begin tending to wounded or resuming movement, only to be struck again while exposed.
