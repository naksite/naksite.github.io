NAK has a new Modset Tool that allows the Servers and Events team to update mods without having to manually generate and distribute PRESET HTML files.  This will allow for faster updates and more accurate mod pack information.

+ To use, select [Server Info](/servers) from the SnyOps main page and click on the [server](/servers/nak2) you want to get the mod list for.  
+ Click on the [Nak Modset Manager](https://dell-wsl.rove-minor.ts.net/?nak_modded_basic=3026334460,3006516384*) link.  
+ Select the Optional mods you want to use.  You should see the total size of the mods selected.
+ When you click the "Save nak_<name>.html" button, this will generate a new HTML file with the mods you selected and download it.
+ You can then import the HTML file into the ArmA3 Launcher using the guide at the bottom of the page.
